# This is a repository for the work done in the parallel computing class of the Computational Master's program at IFSC-USP.

It contains two main programs, implemented in both sequential and parallel forms, comparing their performance. You will also find a PDF for each program, detailing the theoretical analysis. 
All of them were written in C, using MPI, with a focus on parallel optimization, achieving up to a 29x performance improvement.
